# LCU Automated

## Running The Application

Run the `webApp.exe` from [release](https://github.com/CharmingDays/LeagueCU/releases) or the `webApp.py` 


After running the code or the `webApp.exe` go to localhost:5000 and set the settings there. By default everything is turned off and a file called `userLcuSettings.json` should be created on your desktop.

In order to stop the script, you must close it via `Task Manager`. Look for `webApp.exe` and end it, be sure to check for it again after a few seconds to make sure the Task has ended properly.

#### You'll most likely get a warning from Windows Defender that it's virus when running the `webApp.exe` file. You can compile the code yourself with pyinstaller and using the webApp.spec settings or your own if you don't trust the `webApp.exe` release.
